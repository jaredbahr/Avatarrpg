/**
 * Who made what, and under which licence.
 *
 * One list, three readers: the Credits view in the pause menu, the `NOTICE`
 * file at the repository root (generated from here by `npm run credits`, with
 * a test that compares the two), and the asset check, which refuses to ship a
 * folder under `public/` that no entry accounts for. The game and the
 * repository therefore cannot disagree about a credit, and art cannot arrive
 * without one.
 *
 * A work under a licence that asks for attribution has to appear in the game,
 * not only in the repository, which is why this is content rather than a
 * document. Add the entry in the same commit as the files.
